# Copilot Instructions

## Code Changes Policy
- **Always ask for explicit permission before making any code edits**
- When discussing potential solutions or issues, explain the options first
- Wait for user confirmation before invoking any file editing tools
- Only make changes when explicitly requested with clear action words like "implement this", "make these changes", or "do it"
- If user asks "why did X happen?" or "could we do Y?" - provide explanation and ask what they want to do
- Never assume a question is a request to modify code
