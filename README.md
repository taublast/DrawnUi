DrawnUI is a rendering and UI composition engine for .NET, powered by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp) with gestures, layouts, effects and animations running with hardware acceleration.

## What's New 1.10.5.13
*  Fixed `SkiaImageManager` cache keys now slash-agnostic on all platforms: `GetFromCache("/media/x.png")` and `GetFromCache("media/x.png")` hit the same cached entry (was a silent cache miss on Blazor after path-resolution changes, e.g. missing preloaded sprites).

 ### Previously

*  Hotfix for smoother rendering loop frames sync
*  Hotfix for templated layouts which were cached (BindableLayout-like), were not invalidated when applying staged structure changes
* Fixed SkiaCarousel changing selected index in the middle of animating.
* Fix children clipping in viewport when children had effects. `ClipContentPath` is now in base.
* Fix FPS metering for capped scenarions.
* Fixed Split=1 on a grid without ColumnDefinitions.
* Target fps now allows floats instead of integers for more fluent animations, resulting in smoother scrolling etc.
* Scrolling ending jagging removed on density < 1.5 devices.
* SkiaLayout Wrap fix for auto-sized children, other layout fixes
