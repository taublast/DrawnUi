Replace native controls with a Skia Canvas! 🤩 On **iOS**, **MacCatalyst**, **Android**, **Windows** with hardware acceleration.

Rendering engine with an enhanced layout system, gestures and animations powered by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).   

* To use inside a usual MAUI app, consume drawn controls by wrapping inside `Canvas` views.
* To create a totally drawn app with just one `Canvas` as root view, use `SkiaShell` + `SkiaViewSwitcher` for navigation between screens with modals, popups, toasts etc.
* Drawn controls are totally virtual, no native views/handlers.
* Design in XAML or [code-behind](Fluent.md)
* Free to use under the MIT license, a nuget package is available.

Current development state is _ALPHA for prod_.

>This is a rendering engine for creating and rendering your own controls, pre-shipped are here for a quick start.

 ## ‼️ Development Notes

* .NET 9 only, Maui.Controls 9.0.70 minimum.
* All files to be consumed (images etc) must be placed inside the MAUI app Resources/Raw folder, subfolders allowed. If you need to load from the native app folder use prefix "file://". Note that MAUI supports only lowercase filenames of resources and while uppercase might works for you on some plaforms they will not be read on iOS.  
* Accessibility support is compatible and is on the roadmap.

## 🌱 What Was New Previously

* iOS images caching with `ImageCaching.Nuke` for urls
* Fix Android and Apple SKGLView not updating after view returned back to visible tree after being out of the tree. This is that case in MAUI when you navigate away from a page and when you return the canvas is either blank or frozen.
 
* Animation extensions for label and all controls: `TextColorToAsync` `BackgroundColorToAsync`
* Fixed `SkiaCheckbox` not triggering event
* Fluent `OnTapped` uses callback instead of effect, has second overload with gesture info
* Fixed `SkiaLottie` and other `AnimateFramesRenderer` not updating when Started
* Fixed rare crash in layout when ItemTemplate is null
* 
* `SkiaCacheType.ImageComposite` implementation for `Absolute` layout
* Cache recycling improvements
* Added translation transforms for `SkiaCacheType.ImageComposite` dirty regions usage.
* Fix `SkiaRichLabel` spans invaldation when font changes for existing label

* Recycling cache/SkiaImage surfaces to reduce allocations
* General layout calculation performance boost
* Recycled cells stack MeasureVisible performance boost
* FirstVisibleIndex/LastVisibleIndex for stacks 

* The nuget package `DrawnUi.Maui` replaces the old package Id, you can still use the old one kept for compatibility for some time.
* Docs, first appearence inside `/docs`! To teach LMs use `/aidocs` subfolder.
* Windows x64 doesn't require MSIX mode anymore, thanks to [Tommi Gustafsson](https://github.com/TommiGustafsson-HMP)
* `SkiaCamera` inside DrawnUi.Maui.Camera: iOS, MacCatalyst, Windows, Android implementations.
* `SkiaShape` now can contain many `Children` instead of one `Content`. Plus fixes for stroke and other for pixel-perfect rendering.
* `SkiaImage` rescaling quality fix after for skia v3.
* `SkiaScroll` added additional mouse wheel support for scrolling on windows, added FirstVisibleIndex, LastVisibleIndex props
* Stack and absolute layouts now correctly apply one-directional `Fill` of children, might break some legacy UIs (or might not). `Margins` and `Padding` now work properly everywhere.
* Can override virtual `OnMeasuring`, while `Measure` is not virtual anymore to assure faster screen creation and avoid re-measurements when initializing for the first time.
* Performance and safety optimizations for accelerated rendering handlers (`SkiaViewAccelerated:SKGLView`) on all platforms.
* Windows accelerated handler is now synched with display when its refresh rate is >=120.
* Frame time interpolator adjustments for DrawnUi.Maui.Game.
* Many other silent fixes and new properties/features.
* Example apps updated to align with changes.
