Rendering engine for .NET MAUI with gestures and animations and much more, powered by [SkiaSharp](https://github.com/mono/SkiaSharp).   

Supports **iOS**, **MacCatalyst**, **Android**, **Windows** with hardware acceleration.

* To use inside a usual MAUI app, by wrapping drawn controls into `Canvas` views.
* To create a totally drawn apps with just one `Canvas` as root view.
* Drawn controls are totally virtual, no native views/handlers.
* Design in XAML or [code-behind](https://drawnui.net/articles/first-app-code.html)
* Free to use under the MIT license, nuget package available.

## Features

* __Use virtual controls to draw your UI__
* __Create your own animated pixel-perfect controls__
* __Port existing native controls to drawn__
* __Design in XAML or code-behind__
* __2D and 3D Transforms__
* __Visual effects__ for every control, filters and shaders
* __Animations__ targeting max FPS
* __Caching system__ for faster re-drawing
* __Optimized for performance__, rendering only visible elements, recycling templates etc
* __Gestures__ support for anything, panning, scrolling, zooming etc
* __Keyboard support__, track any key
* __Navigate__ on the canvas with MAUI Shell-like techniques

## üÜï What's new

* Sandbox and Tutorial projects UI cache tuned for max fps
* `SkiaButton` uses `Padding` property for frame content, see Sandbox project Buttons example.
* Fix cache performance `ImageDoubleBuffered`, improved cache `Image`
* Fixed cache type `OperationsFull`, god mode that records a larger area than your control, to pick up glow, shadows etc, if you need to animate its destination cache one of the the parents so it uses its bounds instead of the top canvas.
* Some animated controls now have `ImageDoubleBuffered` set as default (lottie and similar)
* `SkiaImage` performance fix to avoid changing source when was created from same string with converter. Added retry logic for all platforms.
* `IsLooped` property implemented for `SkiaCarousel` (Sandbox project carousel example updated), for never-ending scrolls, also added `SwipeSpeed` property.
* `Gestures` property for `Canvas` has new value `SoftLock` for smart working together inside native ScrollView: You started your custom control panning (ex: SkiaCarousel) MAUI ScrollView will not scroll until you release. Note that using `Lock` value instead will totally prevent parent ScrollView to receive panning gestures. Using new `AppoMobi.Maui.Gestures` gestures nuget.
* `SkiaLabel` subpixel rendering quality improved, note it can be can turned off with `Super.FontSubPixelRendering` static property.
* Improved font auto-selection for unicode symbols on **Android** + **Apple** for `SkiaRichLabel` and related, all currency, Chinese etc symbols now properly displayed. Implemented platform agnostic caching for auto-find font.
* Fixed `MinimumWidthRequest` and `MinimumHeightRequest` not applying margins.
* Fixed animators sometimes not starting when created to early, including `SkiaLottie` one.
* Fixed `SkiaScroll` refresh mechanics, added refresh feature with `SkiaLottie` tinted indicator to News Feed Scroller tutorial code.

  
## üí° Hint of the Day

**‚ùì Q: How to make images to Fade-In when loaded?**

**üí° A:** Subclass `SkiaImage` to define your animation:

```csharp
public class BannerImage : SkiaImage
{
    public override void OnSuccess(string source)
    {
        base.OnSuccess(source);

        this.Opacity = 0.01;
        _ = this.FadeToAsync(1, 300, Easing.SinIn);
    }
}
```

## Quick Start

Install the package:
```bash
dotnet add package DrawnUi.Maui
```

Initialize in `MauiProgram.cs`:
```csharp
builder.UseDrawnUi();
```

Use in XAML:
```xml
<ContentPage xmlns:draw="http://schemas.appomobi.com/drawnUi/2023/draw">
    <draw:Canvas Gestures="Enabled">
        <draw:SkiaLayout Type="Column" Spacing="16" Padding="32">
            <draw:SkiaLabel Text="Hello DrawnUI" FontSize="24" />
            <draw:SkiaButton Text="Click Me" Tapped="OnButtonClicked" />
        </draw:SkiaLayout>
    </draw:Canvas>
</ContentPage>
```

Need more performance? Set canvas `RenderingMode` to `Accelerated`.

## FAQ

**Q: What is the difference between DrawnUi and other drawn frameworks?**  
A: It is not a framework but a library for .NET MAUI, to make creating drawn UI easy for everyone.

**Q: Why use DrawnUI instead of native controls?**  
A: Gives you complete control over rendering and appearance and can be much more performant for complex UIs. 

**Q: Do I need to know SkiaSharp?**  
A: No. Use the prebuilt controls and customize them. All controls are designed to be subclassed and most methods are virtual.

**Q: Can I use XAML/code-behind?**  
A: Yes, both XAML and code-behind are supported.

**Q: Can I embed native MAUI controls?**  
A: Yes, use `SkiaMauiElement` to wrap native controls like WebView inside your drawn UI.

**Q: Can I embed drawn controls into my usual MAUI app?**  
A: Yes, use `Canvas` to wrap drawn controls inside your MAUI UI.
